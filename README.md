# Fremont Bridge Bicycle Counter – Ensonification Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory analysis of an audio ensonification
created from the Fremont Bridge Bicycle Counter dataset, which records hourly
bicycle traffic in Seattle over many years.

The purpose of this analysis is to examine how audio-based data communication
represents long-term trends, seasonality, and disruptions, and to evaluate
what aspects of the underlying data are emphasized or de-emphasized by this
communication method.

## Contents
- A Jupyter/Colab notebook analyzing the ensonification using:
  - Time-domain (waveform) analysis
  - Frequency-domain (FFT) analysis
  - Time–frequency representations (spectrograms)
  - Interactive 3D time–frequency–amplitude visualizations
  - Descriptive audio feature summaries
- The audio file used for analysis (extracted from the public webpage for
  exploratory purposes)

## Key Observations
- The ensonification primarily encodes information through changes in
  amplitude (loudness), rather than pitch or harmonic structure.
- Strong seasonal cycles and long-term disruptions are perceptually salient,
  while daily variability and short-term fluctuations are smoothed out.
- Audio-based communication offers accessibility benefits but is less efficient
  than visual representations for rapid comparison and precise interpretation.

## Notes
This analysis was conducted as part of an exploration into data communication
methods and is intended to complement written discussion in an academic
application context.
